# How to use these commands

### Build and Run Command (bar)

Use this command to build and run your C program. Navigate to your project's root directory and execute:

```bar **[_ _path to your main C++ file_ _]**```

Or simply:

```bar```

If your main file is named 'main.cpp'. This command compiles the main file using g++ and outputs the executable to a bin folder, which is created if it doesn't already exist.
